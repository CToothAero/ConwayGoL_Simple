# ConwayGoL_Simple

Conway's Game of Life is a study in complex behavior arising from only three simple rules and an initial condition.

3 Rules:
1 - If a cell is 'alive' and is surrounded by fewer than 2 live cells, then the cell dies. As if from lack of external life support.
2 - If a cell is 'alive' and is surrounded by more than 3 live cells, then the cell dies. As if from over competition for resources.
3 - If a cell is 'dead' and is surrounded by exactly 3 live cells, then the cell lives. As if growth from proper available support.

This program is intended to, on a 2D board, run: a) randomly seeded scenarios of the Game of Life or b) a demonstration of a "flyer" generator.

The User must be able to choose whether to operate the random or demonstration method.
The "Live" status will be denoted by a capital o, "O". The "Dead" status will be denoted by a blank space.
